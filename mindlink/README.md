# MindLink: Personalized AI Agents for Therapists and Psychologists

MindLink is a platform designed to empower therapists and psychologists by providing them with personalized AI agents tailored to their specific needs. These agents can assist with a variety of tasks, enhance client interactions, and streamline workflows.

## Core Features

*   **Personalized AI Agents:** Each user (therapist or psychologist) can create a unique AI agent designed to assist them in their practice.
*   **User Registration and Login:** A secure system allows users to register and access their personalized agent.
*   **Claude 3 Integration:** The agents are powered by Anthropic's Claude 3, a cutting-edge large language model.
*   **Customizable Tool Selection:** Users can choose which tools to add to their agent. Initially, this includes:
    *   **Summarize Tool:**  Condenses text, such as client notes, into concise summaries.
    *   **Google Search Tool:** Allows the agent to perform web searches to gather information.
*   **Client Notes Management:** Users can upload and manage text files containing notes from their client interactions. These notes are used to inform the agent and will be used to create summaries.
*   **Psychology Knowledge Integration:** Users can provide resources (text files or prompts) to equip their agent with specific psychological theories and knowledge relevant to their practice.
*   **A2A Network Integration:** Each user's agent is assigned a unique A2A (Agent-to-Agent) URL, making it discoverable within a network of other agents.
*   **Optional Orchestrator Agent:** Users can choose to have an orchestrator agent that acts as a central hub. This agent will:
    *   First, consult the user's knowledge and notes.
    *   Then, if needed, search for other agents in the A2A network that might be able to provide additional support or solutions.

## Future Development

*   **Complex Database Integration:** Move beyond simple text files to a more robust database for client notes and knowledge.
