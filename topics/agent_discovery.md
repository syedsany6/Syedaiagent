A2A's [AgentCard](/documentation.md#agent-card) standardizes the *format* of the data shared during discovery. However there are unlimited ways to discover these agent cards. We anticipate this being an open topic for discussion and look forward to ideas from the community.

Here is our current thinking. 

## Open Discovery
We recommend enterprises host their agent cards at a well-known path. Specifically: https://`DOMAIN`/.well-known/agent.json. Clients will use DNS to resolve a known or found domain, send a simple `GET` request to the path, and receive the agent card. 

This will enable web-crawlers and applications to easily discover agents for known or configured domains. This effectively reduces the discovery process to "find a domain". 

## Curated Discovery (Registry-Based)
We anticipate enterprise applications making curated registries of agents available through a catalog interface. This opens up more enterprise scenarios such as organization-specific agent registries that are curated by an administrator. 


We recommend designing a globally unique Agent Registrar to uniformly manage Agents under various organizations, providing Registry-Based Agent service discovery capabilities.

Organizations can manage their own Agents, and each Agent must belong to exactly one organization.
Agent Registrar includes the following required capabilities:
- Organization Management: Responsible for organization registration, updating, and deletion, such as being able to answer "Create a new organization".
- Agent Registry: Responsible for Agent registration, deregistration, and updating registration information, such as being able to answer "Register my agent with the following capabilities: ...".
- Agent Discovery: Discovering suitable registered Agents based on various standards and capabilities, such as being able to answer "Find an agent that can process PDF documents".

Agent Registrar can also provide some optional capabilities:
- Registry Analytics: Provides analysis and insights about registered Agents, such as being able to answer "Which agent has the highest rating?".

### Organization Management

Organizations need to register with the Agent Registrar, and the Agent Registrar will assign a unique `organizationID` to each organization.

###  Agent Registry 

#### Agent Visibility
Agent visibility refers to whether the Agent can be discovered by other Agents within or outside the organization. The way an Agent registers with the Agent Registrar affects its visibility.

Agents can choose to register with the Agent Registrar in either a private or public way, with public registration being the default.

| Agent Registration Method | Can be discovered by other Agents within the organization | Can be discovered by Agents outside the organization |
|-------------|----------------------|--------------------|
| private     | Yes                  | No                 |
| public      | Yes                  | Yes                |

Agents control their visibility by explicitly specifying the `organizationID` and `visibility` fields.
All interactions with the Agent Registrar need to include the `organizationID` field to indicate which Organization the Agent belongs to. Each Agent can have one and only one `organizationID`.

When using the Agent Registrar for Agent registration and updates, use the `visibility` field, which has two possible values:
- `private`: Visible only to other Agents within the same organization
- `public`: Visible to Agents both within and outside the organization

#### Authentication and Authorization

When registering with the Agent Registrar, Agents need to have credentials distributed by the organization (such as an `organizationToken`) for authentication.


### Agent Implementation of the Agent Registrar

The Agent Registrar can be implemented as an Agent, with its Agent Card described as:

*We **are** considering adding Registry support to the protocol - please drop us a [note](https://github.com/google/A2A/blob/main/README.md#contributing) with your opinion and where you see this being valuable as a standard*

## Private Discovery (API-Based)
There will undoubtably be private "agent stores" or proprietary agents where cards are exchanged behind custom APIs.

*We **are not** considering private discovery APIs as an A2A concern - please drop us a [note](https://github.com/google/A2A/blob/main/README.md#contributing) with your opinion and where you see this being valuable as a standard*

## Securing Agent Cards

Agent cards may contain sensitive information. Implementors may decide to secure their agent cards behind controls that require authentication and authorization. For example, within an organization, even an open discovery at a well-known path could be guarded by mTLS and restricted to specific clients. Registries and Private Discovery APIs should require authentication and return different artifacts for different identities. 

Note that implementors may include credential information (such as API Keys) in their Agent Cards. It is recommended that this information is NEVER available without Authentication.
